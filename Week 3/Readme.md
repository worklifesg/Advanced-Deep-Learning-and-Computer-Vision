## Week 3

This week, we will cover Deep Generative Models and application such as Neural Style transfer and Object Detection:
```
Understand Generative Adversarial Networks
Exlain Generative vs. Discriminative Algorithms
Outline the GAN Architecture
Differentiate between the types of GANs
Generate images with DCGANs
Augment datasets with conditional GANs
Translate images with CycleGANs and pix2pix networks
------------------------------------------
Describe neural style transfer
Extract content from an image
Extract style from an image
Perform neural style transfer using TensorFlow and PyTorch
Implement CNN architecture
Use the concept of transfer learning to model complex networks
Explain object detection with YOLO
```

**Class Learning Notebooks**

  * [[Notebook 1 DCGAN CIFAR10](https://github.com/worklifesg/Advanced-Deep-Learning-and-Computer-Vision/blob/main/Week%202/RBM_Practice_MNIST.ipynb)]
  * [[Notebook 2 CGAN FASHION MNIST](https://github.com/worklifesg/Advanced-Deep-Learning-and-Computer-Vision/blob/main/Week%202/AdvancedDL_OpenCV_10Oct2020.ipynb)] 

**Assisted Practice Projects** (To be completed)

  * Use Keras or TensorFlow to build a deep generative model that will translate drawings of shoes to designs.
  * Use YOLO v3 pretrained model for object detection
